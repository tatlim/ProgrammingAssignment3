# Coursera: Getting and Cleaning Data, Course Project

This repository contains an R script `run_analysis.R`.
This script downloads an UCI HAL data set and calculates mean values for a number of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements.
These mean values are calculated for each _subject_ (test person) and _activity_ (physical performance).
The resulting data frame is then saved to a `tidy_data.txt` file.
